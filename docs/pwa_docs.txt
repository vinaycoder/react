Objective - Light Weight + High Speed

Tech Stack -

Polymer - (template engine) / (Block wise caching in rendering)
React -
Angular -


Ideas -

- High amount of unused CSS
- Ajax (JSON) + Ajax Centralised (On Error + Exception Handling) + Request sequencing
- Template Structuring Per Page Type (Static HTMl) && Dynamic Content Filling (over the static HTML)
- Removing prototype from frontend
- Heavy caching of images / js


First Step -

Ajax - Cache First / Network Later (But network should update cache)

Cache of images / js / css








App Shell - The app's shell is the minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction.


All of the UI and infrastructure is cached locally using a service worker so that on subsequent loads, the Progressive Web App only needs to retrieve the necessary data, instead of having to load everything.



We can use the PWA features -


Caching the app shell.


Client Side Rendering

1. We can cache static content.
2. We can cache whole server revert of main pages.
